# newsletter_signup_project

Newsletter signup project is the project I tried to have interaction with API (Mailchimp API).

In this project, There are only 3 required inputs; Firstname, Lastname and email. These 3 inputs that signed up in web page are collected into mailchimp for a any purposes such as news update or marketing campaign.

For safety sake, mailchimp API KEY and ID are removed.

Moreover, I deployed this web application on Heroku platform.

So, you can view this website and try to type any inputs and sign up via: https://desolate-badlands-21391.herokuapp.com/
